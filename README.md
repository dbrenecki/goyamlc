## Summary

go yaml marshaler does what the standard goyaml marshaler doesn't and offers maintaining comments from your structs as part of your yaml. This offers the ability to have documentation or examples represented in yaml autogenerated from your struct config.

Example

```go
type Foo struct {
    // some field
    x string `yaml:"x"`
    // some other field
    y string `yaml:"y"`
}
```

Would generate:

```yaml
foo:
  # some field
  x: string
  # some other field
  y: string
```

More complex examples would include nested structs and multiple root structs.
